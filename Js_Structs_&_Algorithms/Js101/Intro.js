//Data types and declarations :
ANY VARIABLE CREATED WITHOUT A TYPE (var, let or const) IS A GLOBAL VARIABLE
var = Variable
let = can be used to name a variable the same name as a previous var declaration
const = read only const


( % ) = remainder equals the remainder of a division not a result

( ' ) / ( " ) = single or double quotes make no diff

( === ) = Strict equality operator compares the object type rather than its value 
so '3' === 3 will return False as the first is a string and the second an int.





//Functions
console.log(""); = basic output function

console.log("text".length); = size of string output

variable.length = size of variable, not  function, braces are not required

( [] ) = Subscript operator works the same
( const myArray = ["string", 2]; ) = Array declaration
( const myArray = [[]] [[]]; ) = Nested arrays declaration (subscript indexing is annoying tho)


//Pushing and poping values from an array will render the removed values accessible
myArray.push(4) = pushBack
myArray.unshift(4) = pushFront

myArray.pop() = resizeLast
myArray.shift() = resizeFirst
( functionName(); ) = Calling a function
